                ==========  TASKS  ==========
                1. FIND the single policy chapter, section, paragraph, or sentence that matches the user’s event.
                1.b CHECK that a guarantee actually exists for the user’s risk
                    • If no clause grants this type of benefit → choose "No - Unrelated event".
                1.c CONFIRM the guarantee is active for timing / territory / object
                    • If the guarantee is outside its validity window → "No - Unrelated event".

                2. DECIDE eligibility:            # (use exactly one of)
                   • "Yes"
                   • "No - Unrelated event"
                   • "No - condition(s) not met"

                3. QUOTE policy:
                   • If "Yes":   – sentence(s) that grant coverage
                                 – sentence(s) that state the amount **(if an amount sentence exists)**
                   • If "No - condition(s) not met": quote only the sentence(s) that show the missing condition
                   • If "No - Unrelated event": no quote

                4. SANITY CHECK
                   – If you found both a coverage sentence *and* an amount sentence → eligibility must be "Yes".
                   – If you found a coverage sentence but no amount sentence anywhere in the policy → eligibility is still 
                     "Yes" and "amount_policy" must be null.

                5. OUTPUT exactly in the JSON schema below.

                ==========  WHEN DECIDING “condition(s) not met” VS. “Yes”  ==========

                • If the user’s event matches the loss description in a coverage clause:
                    – Check the *same* clause (and any cross-referenced article) for
                      explicit prerequisites, exclusions, timing limits, territorial limits, sub-limits, or person definitions.
                    – If at least one of those conditions is clearly **not satisfied
                      in the user’s story**, choose "No - condition(s) not met".
                    – Otherwise choose "Yes".

                • Treat a prerequisite as **satisfied by default** when it is
                  *logically inherent* in the event
                  (e.g. a derouted/lost/late bag was checked in; a cancellation
                  request implies the trip hasn’t started yet; a hospitalised
                  person hasn’t travelled).

                • DO NOT require procedural steps (PIR, police report, 24-h notice, etc.)
                  to be mentioned; assume they can still be provided later unless the user
                  admits they didn’t do them.
