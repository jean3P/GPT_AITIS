                    – Check the *same* clause (and any cross-referenced article) for
                      explicit prerequisites, exclusions, or timing limits.
                    – If at least one of those conditions is clearly **not satisfied
                      in the user’s story**, choose "No - condition(s) not met".
                    – Otherwise choose "Yes".

                • Treat a prerequisite as **satisfied by default** when it is
                  *logically inherent* in the event:
                    (e.g. a derouted/lost/late bag was checked in; a cancellation
                    request implies the trip hasn’t started yet; a hospitalised
                    person hasn’t travelled).

                • DO NOT require procedural steps (PIR, police report, 24-h notice, etc.)
                  to be mentioned; assume they can still be provided later unless user
                  admits they didn’t do them.
